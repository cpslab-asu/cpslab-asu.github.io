## Abstract

In this paper, we present the Python package $\Psi$-TaLiRo which is a toolbox
for temporal logic robustness guided falsification of Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS). $\Psi$-TaLiRo is a completely modular toolbox supporting multiple
temporal logic offline monitors as well as optimization engines for test case
generation. Among the benefits of $\Psi$-TaLiRo is that it supports search-based
test generation for many different types of systems under test. All
$\Psi$-TaLiRo modules can be fully modified by the users to support new
optimization and robustness computation engines as well as any System under Test
(SUT).
